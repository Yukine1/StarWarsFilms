## Technologies

1. I used React.js to build this single page application.
2. Use Route library to switching page

### What now not implemented but in process

Not implemented additiona information like characters, vehicles, planets, because this points has they're own API link.

My ideas on how I can implement features

1. Make all AJAX request from the API which I need and then use them. Not good because I'll send a lot of request to server.
2. Make AJAX request when I click on link with film. Better but not best decision because each time I click on link I send AJAX request.
3. Make 3 request big reaust from API with all I needed information and then use them. I think this is the best decision, because only 3 request and ALL information which I need(films list, charachers list etc.).
